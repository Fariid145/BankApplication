        Love is complex.
        
        A mix of emotions, behaviors, and beliefs associated with strong feelings of affection, protectiveness, warmth, and
        respect for &nbsp;  2zanother person.
        
        Love can also be used to apply to non-human animals, to principles, and to religious beliefs. For example, a person
        might say he or she loves his or her dog, loves freedom, or loves God.
        What Is Love?
        
        Love has been a favored topic of philosophers, poets, writers, and scientists for generations, and different people and
        groups have often fought about its definition.
        
        While most people agree that love implies strong feelings of affection, there are many disagreements about its precise
        meaning, and one person’s “I love you” might mean something quite different than another’s.
